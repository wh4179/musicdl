# 📦 Install

You have three installation methods to choose from,

```sh
# from pip
pip install musicdl
# from github repo method-1
pip install git+https://github.com/CharlesPikachu/musicdl.git@master
# from github repo method-2
git clone https://github.com/CharlesPikachu/musicdl.git
cd musicdl
python setup.py install
```

Some of the music downloaders supported by `musicdl` require additional CLI tools to function properly, mainly for decrypting encrypted search/download requests and audio files.
These CLI tools include [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Specifically,

- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): At the moment, only `TIDALMusicClient` depends on FFmpeg for audio file decoding.
  If you don’t need to use `TIDALMusicClient` when working with `musicdl`, you don’t need to install FFmpeg.
  After installing it, you should run the following command in a terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) to check whether FFmpeg is on your system `PATH`:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -version
  ```
  If FFmpeg is installed correctly and on your `PATH`, this command will print the FFmpeg version information (*e.g.*, a few lines starting with `ffmpeg version ...`).
  If you see an error like `command not found` or `'ffmpeg' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, then FFmpeg is either not installed or not added to your `PATH`.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): Currently, only `YouTubeMusicClient` in `musicdl` depends on Node.js, so if you don’t need `YouTubeMusicClient`, you don’t have to install Node.js.
  Similar to FFmpeg, after installing Node.js, you should run the following command to check whether Node.js is on your system `PATH`:
  ```bash
  node -v (npm -v)
  ```
  If Node.js is installed correctly, `node -v` will print the Node.js version (*e.g.*, `v22.11.0`), and `npm -v` will print the npm version.
  If you see a similar `command not found` / `not recognized` error, Node.js is not installed correctly or not available on your `PATH`.


# 🚀 Quick Start

After a successful installation, you can run the snippet below,

```python
from musicdl import musicdl

music_client = musicdl.MusicClient(music_sources=['MiguMusicClient', 'NeteaseMusicClient', 'QQMusicClient'])
music_client.startcmdui()
```

Or just run `musicdl -m NeteaseMusicClient` (maybe `musicdl --help` to show usage information) from the terminal.

```
Usage: musicdl [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  -k, --keyword TEXT              The keywords for the music search. If left
                                  empty, an interactive terminal will open
                                  automatically.
  -m, --music-sources, --music_sources TEXT
                                  The music search and download sources.
                                  [default: MiguMusicClient,NeteaseMusicClient
                                  ,QQMusicClient]
  -i, --init-music-clients-cfg, --init_music_clients_cfg TEXT
                                  Config such as `work_dir` for each music
                                  client as a JSON string.
  -r, --requests-overrides, --requests_overrides TEXT
                                  Requests.get kwargs such as `headers` and
                                  `proxies` for each music client as a JSON
                                  string.
  -c, --clients-threadings, --clients_threadings TEXT
                                  Number of threads used for each music client
                                  as a JSON string.
  -s, --search-rules, --search_rules TEXT
                                  Search rules for each music client as a JSON
                                  string.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

If you are a VIP user on each music platform, for example, a VIP user of Netease Cloud Music, 
you can pass in the cookies from your logged-in account so that musicdl can download more tracks with higher quality (*e.g.*, flac music files). 
Example code is as follows:

```python
from musicdl import musicdl

your_vip_cookies_with_str_format = ""
your_vip_cookies_with_dict_format = dict(item.split("=", 1) for item in your_vip_cookies_with_str_format.split("; "))
init_music_clients_cfg = dict()
init_music_clients_cfg['NeteaseMusicClient'] = {'default_search_cookies': your_vip_cookies_with_dict_format, 'default_download_cookies': your_vip_cookies_with_dict_format, 'search_size_per_source': 20}
music_client = musicdl.MusicClient(music_sources=['NeteaseMusicClient'], init_music_clients_cfg=init_music_clients_cfg)
music_client.startcmdui()
```

If you want to download lossless-quality music from [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/), 
you need to make sure that [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) is available or that [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is in your environment variables, 
and then use musicdl as follows,

```python
from musicdl import musicdl

music_client = musicdl.MusicClient(music_sources=['TIDALMusicClient'])
music_client.startcmdui()
```

For searching and downloading from YouTube Music, an example usage is shown below,

```python
from musicdl import musicdl

music_client = musicdl.MusicClient(music_sources=['YouTubeMusicClient'])
music_client.startcmdui()
```

For more practical examples, please refer to the usage documentation.
